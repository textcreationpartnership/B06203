            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A True Account how Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Santoft</hi>
happened to be Burnt.</head>
            <p>THere was a little Houſe adjoining to his Dwelling-houſe of about Four Yards Square, the Wall of it about Seven Foot high, cover'd with a Thatched Roof: This Houſe was his Brew-houſe and Baking-houſe; within it ſtood a great Copper juſt under the Thatch, the Room not being Chambered Upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>'s Family were Brewing within this Place, and that Night brought much Wood into it to Boil the Liquor, and more then did it, and left it there careleſly: Now it ſo happened that that Wood took Fire that Night, and got to the Thatch, and ſo ſet Fire to that Houſe; and thereby his Dwelling-houſe was alſo Burnt: And that the Fire ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, is demonſtrable for theſe Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Servants who were in the Houſe perceiving a great Smoak roſe out of Bed, and the Maid running out cried <hi>Fire,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Wo worth this Bookers Wife</hi> (who was the Perſon whom Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> imployed to be his Brewer) <hi>ſhe hath undone us:</hi> One <hi>Thomas Parrot</hi> their near and next Neighbour hearing the Maid thus Cry out, came running haſtily; when he got thither, he ſaw no Fire breaking out outwardly, only a great Smoak through the Thatch the Fire was within, he ſaw none break forth: And it being a low Houſe, as is aforeſaid, he got upon the Houſe Ridge on one ſide and pulled all the Thatch off there; and one <hi>Watſon</hi> a Weak Old Man who lodged in Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>'s Houſe that Night, got upon another patr of the outſide, but had not ſtrength enough to pull off the Thatch where he was, ſo that the Fire prevailed upon him, and got hold of the Thatch, and burnt out furiouſly, inſomuch as they two could not quench it, but it ſoon got hold of the Dwelling-houſe, which was alſo Thatched, and ſo burnt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſaid <hi>Parrot</hi> Depoſed upon Oath, the Fire was occaſioned as aforeſaid; and that had there been another Man as ſtrong as himſelf, they could have ſaved all the Buildings The Night was very Calm, and by the help of this <hi>Parrot,</hi> and ſome others that came afterwards, moſt of Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>'s Houſhold Goods were ſaved (except ſome Lumber Goods)</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next day after the Fire, Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> contrived how he might lay the Burning of it to the charge of the Country, and told his Servants he muſt Charge the Country with it: And to that end, he and ſome with him, made ſome Marches with Line-hards, or Tow, wrapped together, and tied on a Stick, and got another thing wherewith he uſed to Greaſe his Coach, and then carried them amongſt the Thatch which was faln from the Houſe, and had eſcaped Burning and laid them down there, and then took them up again and ſaid to them, <hi>Now you ſee I took theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ings from amongſt the Thath;</hi> and when you are called to it, you may ſafely Swear you ſee me take them out of the Thatch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> afterwards going to a Juſtice of Peace, and taking his Maid Servant <hi>Suſan Winder</hi> with him, would have had her to have Sworn that thoſe Matches were found amongſt the Thatch, and that the Houſe was Burnt thereby, and ſhe would not; and he was thereupon very angry with her and ſaid, <hi>What then came you with me hither for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> having a great Malice againſt <hi>Thomas Sparke</hi> a Commoner in <hi>Epworth,</hi> was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have laid the Burning of his Houſe to his Charge; and accordingly ſoon after the Fire, he went to <hi>Ric Aldus</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Belton,</hi> to enquire whether <hi>Sparke</hi> was there all that Night the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> becauſe he was told he was: <hi>Aldus</hi> telling him he was there the whole Night, Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> would have perſwaded him to have ſaid, <hi>that he was out two hours of the Night;</hi> but <hi>Aldus</hi> fully ſatisfying him he was not, Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> made anſwer, <hi>If it be ſo, then I doubt the Fire came by the careleſsneſs of my own Servants; for they had much Wood that Night in the Brew houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> out of his further miſchievous Malice would have perſuaded <hi>Tho Parrot</hi> and <hi>Suſan Winder</hi> to ſay and ſwear, that <hi>Gunpowder</hi> was ſtrewed in ſome places about the Houſe: And ſaid to them, <hi>Do you not ſee Powder lie here?</hi> whereas it was nothing but ſome black Aſhes or Cinders of ſome burnt Wood; and they could ſee no Powder.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> by a late ſcandalous Printed Paper of his, charges the Burning of his ſaid Houſe on all the Commoners: But all along ſince the Fire he did not ſo, ſometimes he charged it upon one, and after upon another; and he Bound the ſaid <hi>Tho Sparke</hi> over to the laſt Aſſizes at <hi>Lincoln</hi> about it; and when he ſaw how he was provided with Witneſſes to make his Defence, being prepared to prove all the aforeſaid things, then he preferred no Indictment againſt him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> hath ſince ſaid to <hi>Robert Whiteley,</hi> That he, and none but he burnt the ſaid Houſe, And alſo to <hi>Robert Bernard,</hi> he and the ſaid <hi>Sparke</hi> burnt it: And at other times he charged <hi>Richard Scot, William Veſſey,</hi> and <hi>William Kynman</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now upon all theſe Circumſtances, which are great Truths, it is moſt evident, the Fire accidentally hapned by the careleſsneſs of</hi> Mr. Reading's <hi>Servants, as many times (too often) Fires in other Places have done: And this will be made evidently appear by credible Witneſſes.</hi>
